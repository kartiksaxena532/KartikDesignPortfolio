🌐 Beyond pixels and color palettes, I believe in the power of collaboration. Working closely with clients and cross-functional teams, I aim to create designs that not only meet the project objectives but also resonate with the target audience.

📚 Continuous learning is integral to my design philosophy. Whether it's experimenting with new design tools, attending design conferences, or diving into emerging trends, I am committed to evolving my skills and staying ahead in the dynamic world of design.

🌟 When I'm not pushing pixels, you can find me exploring UI/UX, which not only rejuvenate my creative spirit but also contribute to my unique design perspective.

Skills: NEXT / TAILWIND / NODE / MONGO
